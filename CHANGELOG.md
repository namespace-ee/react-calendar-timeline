# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres (more or less) to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

* add scroll ref

### 0.18.2

### Fixed

* `onCanvasClick` not fired - #383
* cursor marker disappear while hovering over item - #378

### 0.18.1

### Fixed

* Date passed to CursorMarker child is wrong - #379
* groupRenderer doesnt work for right sidebar - #377

### 0.18.0

### Fixed

* Timeline now respects changes to `headerLabelFormats` and `subHeaderLabelFormats` - #362

### Added

* timeline markers - user can have more control over markers that are rendered on the timeline. See `TimelineMarkers` section of README for documentation - #327

### Breaking

* Removed support for React 15 and lower.  This is due to the fact that 16+ supports returning arrays from render, something that the TimelineMarker feature relies on.
* removed `showCursorLine` prop in favor of using the `CursorMarker` component. See `TimelineMarkers` section of README for documentation.

```diff
import Timeline,
+ {TimelineMarkers, CursorMarker}
from 'react-calendar-timeline'

<Timeline
- showCursorLine

- />
+ >

+ <TimelineMarkers>
+  <CursorMarker />
+ </TimelineMarkers>

+ </Timeline>
```

### 0.17.3

### Added
* fix issue with single row header - #359

### 0.17.2

### Added

* support passing `style` prop from item - #347
* `selected` is provided to `itemRenderer` - #348
* simplify logic for calculate dimensions and prevent item width and left properties from being unbounded - (refactoring)

### 0.17.1

### Added

* pass canvasTimeStart/End via timelineContext to the itemRenderer prop

### 0.17.0

### Breaking

* throw more descriptive error if visibleTimeStart/End and defaultTimeStart/End are not passed as props. Timeline no longer calculates visibleTime start and end from items. Removed `onTimeInit` prop as it no longer serves a purpose. - #299
* `interactjs` is a peerDependency (wasn't previously). Upped version to 1.3.4 to fix issue #297

### Fixed

* fix for issue where NaN is returned in onItemMove if the startTime is not unix timestamp #300

### 0.16.3

### Fixed

* tap on canvas now dispatches `onCanvasClicked` - #168
* regression bug related to touch zoom
* code cleanup and refactoring around group rows

### 0.16.2

### Fixed

* clicking on canvas when item is selected now calls `onCanvasClicked` - #312

### 0.16.1

### Added

* added `stickyHeader` to disable/enable timeline header sticking on scroll.
* removed `fullUpdate` prop and functionality. Labels rely on `position: sticky` to show for items that start before `visibleTimeStart`. This (should) greatly improve scroll performance.
* removed extraneous css such as `text-align: center` on `.rct-item`, `.rct-item-overflow` to simplify the dom structure of `Item.js`
* added `headerRef` callback to receive a reference to the header element. Due to the change in how the header positioning is implemented (i.e. using `position: sticky`), there is a need to use a polyfill in [certain browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sticky) that don't support `position: sticky`. With a reference to the header dom element, you can use a polyfill to apply sticky behavior.
* `minimumWidthForItemContentVisibility` prop to control at what width inner item content is rendered.

### Breaking

* removed `fixedHeader` prop in favor of using `position: sticky` by default
* removed import of stylesheets in library code, put onus on user to handle this stylesheet

## 0.15.12

## 0.15.11

### Fixed

* removed `preventDefault` call in item double click handler - #277

## 0.15.10

### Fixed

* fix issue with time report with onItem\* callbacks for browsers that don't support `x` property in rect object - #266

## 0.15.9

### Fixed

* header positioned incorrectly when not fixed/sticky - caused by #236

## 0.15.8

### Fixed

* propTypes error related to Item prop - #239
* onCanvasClick and onCanvasDoubleClick were being called on header click - #236

### Added
